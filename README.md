## Summary

ArcheoCosmesis is a virtual museum about cosmetics in the ancient world. The main idea is investigating how and why Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, the best known civilizations of the Mediterranean antiquity, used cosmetics. It is a tour which, through natural elements, archaeological findings, and cultural objects, leads the visitor to an immersive societal experience. The website is also enriched with the design of an interactive app.
